# Oops, I'm Innocent!

A darkly humorous visual novel and point-and-click adventure. 

While driving through a forest road, you accidentally hit a pedestrian, and only have time to do one thing before the police arrive. Each choice changes the story, leading to one of seven unique endings. Can you uncover them all?

I had sooo much fun making this game with my friend Z, and I'm so happy with how it came out. :D
